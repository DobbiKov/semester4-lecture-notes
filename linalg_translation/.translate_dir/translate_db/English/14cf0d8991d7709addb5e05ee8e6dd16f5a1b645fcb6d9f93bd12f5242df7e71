\begin{theorem}[Taylor-Young formula of order 2 (case \(m=1\))]
    If \(f:D \to \R\) is of class \(C^2\) on \(D\), then for \(X_0 \in D\) and \(H \in \R^n\) such that \(X_0+H \in D\) :
    \[ f(X_0+H) = f(X_0) + \nabla f(X_0) \cdot H + \frac{1}{2} H^T H_f(X_0) H + o(\|H\|^2) \]
    où \(H^T H_f(X_0) H = \sum_{i,j=1}^n \frac{\partial^2 f}{\partial x_i \partial x_j}(X_0) H_i H_j\) is the quadratic form associated with the Hessian.
\end{theorem}
