\begin{theorem}[Continuity of linear maps]
    For a linear map \(A: E \to F\), the following properties are equivalent:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item \(A\) is continuous (at every point of \(E\)).
        \item \(A\) is continuous at \(0_E\).
        \item \(A\) is bounded: \(\exists C \ge 0\) such that \(\forall x \in E, \|Ax\|_F \le C \|x\|_E\).
    \end{enumerate}
\end{theorem}
