\begin{preuve}
   I'm providing intuition. A transition matrix transforms one basis into another; it transforms the vectors of the basis, so it transforms the basis of the O.N.B. into vectors of the basis of the O.N.B. Therefore, according to proposition \ref{prop:isometrie-ssi-transforme-bon-en-bon}, this matrix is orthogonal.
