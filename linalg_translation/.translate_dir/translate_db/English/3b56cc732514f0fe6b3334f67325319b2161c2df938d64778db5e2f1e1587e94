\begin{theorem}.
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Let $U_i$,  $i \in I$ be a collection of open sets. Then,  $\cup_{i \in I} \,U_i$ is open.\\
            Translate: Any union of open sets is open.
        \item If $U_1, \ldots, U_n$ are open
            \[
                \bigcap\limits_{i=1}^{n} \, U_i \text{ is open.}
            \] 
            Translate: \underline{finite} intersection of open sets is open.
    \end{enumerate}
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Let $U_i$,  $i \in I$ be a collection of closed sets. Then,  $\cup_{i \in I} \,U_i$ is closed.\\
            Translate: Any union of closed sets is closed.
        \item If $U_1, \ldots, U_n$ are closed 
            \[
                \bigcap\limits_{i=1}^{n} \, U_i \text{ is closed.}
            \] 
            Translate: \underline{finite} intersection of closed sets is closed.
