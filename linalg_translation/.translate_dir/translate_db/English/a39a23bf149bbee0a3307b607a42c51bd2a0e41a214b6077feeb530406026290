\begin{intuition}
   A Cauchy sequence is like measuring a point and localizing it, i.e:
   \begin{enumerate}
       \item We say it is between $0$ and $1$.
       \item Then, we specify more and say it is between $0.5$ and $0.6$.
       \item Then, between $0.55$ and $0.56$
   \end{enumerate}
   We can infinitely increase the level of precision. That's the idea of a Cauchy sequence.
\end{intuition}
