And this is not only the case for the vector $\begin{pmatrix} -1 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix} $, by taking any vector generated by $v = \begin{pmatrix} -1 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix} $, we will obtain $Av = 2v$.
Such vectors $v$ and the scalars (here: 2) are called eigenvectors and eigenvalues respectively. So, we have the formal definition:
