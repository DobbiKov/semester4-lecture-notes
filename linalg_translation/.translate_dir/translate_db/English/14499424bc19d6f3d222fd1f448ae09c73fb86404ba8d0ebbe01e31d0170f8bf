\begin{theorem}[Sufficient condition for local extremum (Order 2)]
    Let \(f:D \to \R\) be of class \(C^2\) on \(D\) and \(X_0 \in \operatorname{Int}(D)\) a critical point. Let \(q(H) = H^T H_f(X_0) H\) be the Hessian quadratic form.
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item If \(H_f(X_0)\) is \textbf{positive definite} (i.e., \(q(H)>0\) for \(H \neq 0\), or all its eigenvalues are \(>0\)), \(X_0\) is a strict local minimum.
        \item If \(H_f(X_0)\) is \textbf{negative definite} (i.e., \(q(H)<0\) for \(H \neq 0\), or all its eigenvalues are \(<0\)), \(X_0\) is a strict local maximum.
        \item If \(H_f(X_0)\) is \textbf{indefinite} (i.e., \(q(H)\) takes values \(>0\) and \(<0\), or it has eigenvalues of opposite non-zero signs), \(X_0\) is a \textbf{saddle point} (or col), not an extremum.
        \item If \(H_f(X_0)\) is semi-definite (positive or negative) but not defined (i.e., \(q(H) \ge 0\) (or \(\le 0\)) and \(q(H)=0\) for some \(H \neq 0\), or at least one eigenvalue is zero and the others of the same sign or zero), we cannot conclude with this criterion alone (doubtful case).
    \end{enumerate}
