\begin{theorem}\label{thm:trigonalisable-si-scinde}
    An endomorphism is trigonalizable in $K$ if and only if its characteristic polynomial splits in $K$. 
    \par 
    This means that the characteristic polynomial has exactly $n$ roots, where $n = \dim(E)$, and can be written as:
     \[
         P_f(X) = (-1)^n(X - \lambda_1)^{\alpha_1}\cdots(X - \lambda_p)^{\alpha_p}
    \] 
    with $\alpha_1 + \ldots + \alpha_p = n$
\end{theorem}
