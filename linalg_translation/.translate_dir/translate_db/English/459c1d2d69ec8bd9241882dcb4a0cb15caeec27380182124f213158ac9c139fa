\begin{intuition}
   I propose to reflect on what this definition means. 
   Let's recall what the derivative intuitively means in the case $\R^n = \R$ ($n = 1$). 
   Intuitively, if we zoom in on the function we are deriving, it behaves and looks like a line. 
   In the case $R^n = \R^2$, if we zoom in on the function, it looks like a plane. 
   Indeed, that's the idea of the derivative: if we take a tiny step of an ant, the displacement is also small and uniform. 
   By increasing $n$, the derivative gives scalars to construct a subspace of dimension $n-1$ of the space $\R^n$.
