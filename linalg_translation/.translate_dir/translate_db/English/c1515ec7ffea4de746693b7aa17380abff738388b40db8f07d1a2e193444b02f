\begin{definition}
    Let (E, d) be a metric space.
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item $U \subset E$ is open if $\forall x_0 \in U, \, \exists r > 0 \: r(x_0)$ such that $B(x_0, r) \subset U$
        \item $F \subset E$ is closed if $E \setminus F$ is open
    \end{enumerate}
    $\O$ is open and $E$ is open.  $\O$ is closed and $E$ is closed.
\end{definition}
