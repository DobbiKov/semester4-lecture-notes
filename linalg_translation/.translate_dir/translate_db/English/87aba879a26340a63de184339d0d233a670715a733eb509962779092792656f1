    These are my notes taken for the Linear Algebra 2 course at Paris-Saclay University. The essential part of these notes is referenced from the book "Linear Algebra" written by Joseph Grifone \cite{grifone}.

   My notes for other subjects are available on my website: \href{https://dobbikov.com/lecture_notes}{dobbikov.com}

   These notes are translated into Ukrainian and English using the tool \texttt{sci-trans-git} \cite{korotenko-sci-trans-git}
