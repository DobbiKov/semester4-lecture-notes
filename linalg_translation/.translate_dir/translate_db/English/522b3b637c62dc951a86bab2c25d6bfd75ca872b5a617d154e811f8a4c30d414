\begin{definition}\label{def:orthogonal}
     $u, v \in E$ are said to be \underline{orthogonal} if $<u, v> = 0$. We denote $u \perp v$
      \begin{itemize}
         \item Two subsets $A, B$ of $E$ are orthogonal if:
              \[
             \forall u \in A, \forall v \in B, \quad <u, v> = 0
             \] 
         \item If $A \subseteq E$ we call the \textbf{orthogonal of $A$}, denoted $A^{\perp}$, the set
              \[
                  A^{\perp} = \{ u \in E \mid <u, v> = 0 \quad \forall v \in A \}
             \]
             Also known as \textbf{orthogonal complement of $A$}
         \item A family $(v_1, \ldots, v_n)$ of vectors in $E$ is said to be orthogonal if $\forall i \neq j, v_i \perp v_j$. It is said to be orthonormal if it is orthogonal and additionally $\|v_i\| = 1 \quad \forall i \in \{ 1, \ldots, n \}$
     \end{itemize}
