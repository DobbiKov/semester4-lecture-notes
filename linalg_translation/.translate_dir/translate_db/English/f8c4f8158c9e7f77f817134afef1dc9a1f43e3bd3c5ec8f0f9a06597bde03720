Suppose \( A \) is diagonalizable. Then there exist \( A' \) a diagonal matrix and \( P \) an invertible matrix such that: 
\[
A' = P^{-1}AP.
\]
If \( A \) is considered as the matrix of an endomorphism in the canonical basis, then \( A' \) is the matrix of \( f \) in the basis of eigenvectors \( \{v_i\} \).
