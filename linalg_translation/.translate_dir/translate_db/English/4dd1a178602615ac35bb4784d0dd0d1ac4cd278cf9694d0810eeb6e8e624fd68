\begin{prop} To understand this proposition, I advise you to read section \ref{sec:isometrie-et-adjoints}

   Every orthogonal projection is self-adjoint, i.e. if $p$ is an orthogonal projection, then:
   \[
   p^* = p
   \] 
   In matrix notation: let $A$ be a matrix of the projection $p$, then:
    \[
   A^T = A
   \]
