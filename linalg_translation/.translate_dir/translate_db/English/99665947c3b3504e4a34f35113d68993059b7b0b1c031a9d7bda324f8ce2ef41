By deriving this relation:
\[
\frac{dX'}{dt} = P^{-1} \frac{dX}{dt}
\]
(because \( A \) having constant coefficients, \( P \) will also have constant coefficients). Therefore:
\[
\frac{dX'}{dt} = P^{-1}AX = \left( P^{-1}AP \right) X' = A'X'
\]
The system \ref{eq:equation-differentielle-diagonalisation} is therefore equivalent to the system
\[
\frac{dX'}{dt} = A'X'
\]

This system is easily integrated, because \( A' \) is diagonal.\\
Thus, we can solve the system \( \frac{dX}{dt} = AX \) in the following way:
