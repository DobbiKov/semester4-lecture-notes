\begin{definition}[Bounded set]
    A part \(A \subset E\) is \textbf{bounded} if it is contained in a ball, i.e., \(\exists x_0 \in E, \exists R > 0\) such that \(A \subset B(x_0, R)\).
    This is equivalent to: \(\forall x_0 \in E, \exists r > 0\) such that \(A \subset B(x_0, r)\).
    Or again: \(\operatorname{diam}(A) = \sup_{x,y \in A} d(x,y) < \infty\).
\end{definition}
