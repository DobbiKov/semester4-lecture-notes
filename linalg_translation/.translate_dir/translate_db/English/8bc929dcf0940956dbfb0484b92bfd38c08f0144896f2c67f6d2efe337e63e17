\begin{theorem}
    Let $A \in \mathcal{L}(E, F)$. The following properties are equivalent:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item $A: E \to F$ is continuous
        \item $A$ is continuous at $0_E$
        \item $\exists C \ge 0$ such that
            \[
            \|Ax\|_F \le C\|x\|_E \quad \forall x \in E
            \] 
            this is called that $A$ is bounded
        \item $A$ is bounded on $B_E(0, R)$ $\forall R > 0$
    \end{enumerate}
    We say that $A$ is bounded (if $A$ is continuous and linear)
\end{theorem}
