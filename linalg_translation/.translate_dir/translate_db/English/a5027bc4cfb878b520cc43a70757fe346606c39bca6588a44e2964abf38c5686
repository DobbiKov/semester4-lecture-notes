\begin{intuition}
    Since $Q(f) = 0$, therefore $\forall v \in E, Q(f)(v) = 0$ which means
    $\operatorname{Ker}(Q(f)) = E$. $\exists v_1, \ldots, v_p$ such that $v = v_1 +
    \ldots + v_p$. However, all polynomials are pairwise coprime, so
    only one of them annihilates $v_i$, thus $v_i \in \operatorname{Ker}Q_i(f)$ and
    this remains true for all $v_1, \ldots, v_p$. And since the polynomials
    are coprime, if $k \neq j$ and $Q_k(v_i) = 0$, then $Q_j(v_i) \neq
    0$ because $Q_j$ and $Q_k$ are different. Therefore, $\forall i, j \,
    \operatorname{Ker}Q_i \cap \operatorname{Ker}Q_j = \{0\}$.
