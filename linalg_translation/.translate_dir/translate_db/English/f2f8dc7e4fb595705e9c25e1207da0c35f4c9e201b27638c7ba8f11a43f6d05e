    Again, for the proof, we will use proposition \ref{prop:prod-scal-par-matrice} which is very useful, so I advise you to master this concept.
    \par
    Let $\{e_i\}$ be an orthonormal basis of $E$ and let us denote
     \[
    A = M(f)_{e_i} \quad A^* = M(f^*)_{e_i} \quad X = M(x)_{e_i} \quad Y = M(y)_{e_i}
    \] 
    Since we are in an orthonormal basis, the statement is written:
    \[
        \underbrace{(AX)^TY}_{\scalair{f(x),y}} = X^TA^TY = \underbrace{X^T(A^*Y)}_{\scalair{x, f^*(y)}} \quad \forall X, Y \in \mathcal{M}_{n, 1}(\R)
    \] 
    which implies that $A^* = A$ and, furthermore, demonstrates the uniqueness of such adjoint.
