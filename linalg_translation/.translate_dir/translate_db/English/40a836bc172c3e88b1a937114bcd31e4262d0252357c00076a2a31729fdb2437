    This product tells us \textit{how closely the vectors point in the same direction} (cosine tends to 1 when $\theta$ tends to 0º, and cosine tends to 0 when $\theta$ tends to 90º). And this product allows us to have a projection of $X$ onto $Y$ by the formula:
    \[
    Proj(X) = \frac{X \cdot Y}{\|Y\|} \cdot \frac{Y}{\|Y\|}
    \] 
    $X \cdot Y$ gives the length of $X$ and $Y$ together, by dividing this length by $\|Y\|$ (the length of $Y$) we obtain the length of $X$ on Y, we still need to multiply this length by a unit vector (of length 1) that points in the same direction as $Y$, (we obtain it by $\frac{Y}{\|Y\|}$)
